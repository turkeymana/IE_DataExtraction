# My App

This is a brief description of my app.

## Overview

My app is a file upload and parsing application that uses a React frontend and a C# API backend. The application allows users to upload files, which are then parsed and processed by the API.

## Features

* File upload and parsing using React and C# API
* Uses FileController.cs to handle file uploads and parsing
* Uses FileUpload.tsx to render the file upload component
* Uses Program.cs to configure the API and handle requests
* Uses index.tsx to render the React application
* Uses App.tsx to render the main application component

To install my app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the React dependencies
3. Run `dotnet restore` to install the C# API dependencies
4. Run `dotnet run` to start the API
5. Run `npm start` to start the React application
